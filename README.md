# Superconductor-Cavity-control-Simulator-
The software simulates the behavior of the superconducting cavity, and display the cavity voltage, forward / reflected power and detuning frequency. The system also provides beam power of different current and phase, and uses feedback control to control the cavity voltage in a closed loop.
