# Superconductor-Cavity-control-Simulator-
The software simulates the behavior of the superconducting cavity, and display the cavity voltage, forward / reflected power and detuning frequency. Different current and phase of beam power apply to the cavity.Feedback control is used to control the cavity voltage in a closed loop.

the sofeware is use for study,  No guarantee of other issues. If you have any improvement adivise ,please contact: xiezhexin@ihep.ac.cn   .
